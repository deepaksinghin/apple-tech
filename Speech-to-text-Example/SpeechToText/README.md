# Speech-to-Text Example

This directory contains the `SpeechToTextManager` class, utilizing Apple's Speech framework to recognize and transcribe spoken language in real-time. It integrates features like silence detection to manage natural speech pauses and volume monitoring to provide feedback on audio input levels.

## Features

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Transcribes spoken words into text instantly.
- **Silence Detection**: Detects pauses in speech, useful for processing commands or stopping the transcription.
- **Volume Level Monitoring**: Tracks the loudness of the speech, which can help in adjusting microphone sensitivity or providing user feedback.

## Setup

### Requirements

- iOS 13.0+ to ensure compatibility with the latest frameworks and security practices.
- Xcode 11+ for building and compiling the project.
- Swift 5.3+ to take advantage of the latest language features and optimizations.

### Installation

Follow these simple steps to get started with the Speech-to-Text library:

1. **Open the Project**: No specific installations are required. Open `SpeechToText.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. **Run the Project**: Compile and run the project on an iOS device or simulator that meets the above requirements.

## Usage

Integrate and use the Speech-to-Text functionality as follows:

```swift
import SpeechToText

// Initialize the speech manager
let speechManager = SpeechToTextManager.shared

// Start recognizing speech
speechManager.startRecognition()

// Handle the transcribed text
speechManager.onTextTranscription = { text in
    print("Transcribed text: \(text)")
}
